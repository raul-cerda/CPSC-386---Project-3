The Alien Invasion project is meant to recreate a game similar to the Space Invaders of old.
Nine different python files were required to maintain readable code.

Python files include alien, alien_invasion, bullet, button, game_functions, game_stats, scoreboard,
   settings, and ship. Each file manages the part of the game it is named after, with alien_invasion
   containing the main game loop.

Also required are the sounds, images, and high_scores files.
Sounds contains all audio used in game, while images provides the aliens and ship objects.
High_scores contains a plain text list of the highest three scores with default values of 
    1000, 2500, 5000. Achieveing a higher score will write to that file accordingly.

I was unsure what I needed to upload so the entire contents of the project were uploaded to gitHub,
including .idea, _pycache_ and venv.
